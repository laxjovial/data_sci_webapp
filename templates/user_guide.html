                    <p>This is the starting point of your analysis. The goal is to load your dataset into the application.</p>
                    <ol>
                        <li><strong>Choose your source:</strong> Use the dropdown menu to select whether you want to "Upload from Device" or load "From a Web Link (URL)".</li>
                        <li>
                            <strong>If uploading from device:</strong>
                            <ul>
                                <li>Click the "Choose a File" button.</li>

                                <li>Paste the URL into the input field.</li>
                                <li>The application supports direct links to CSV/Excel files, as well as links to files on GitHub and Google Drive. For Google Drive, ensure the file is shared so that "anyone with the link can view".</li>
                            </ul>
                        </li>
                        <li>Click the "Load Dataset" button. You will then be taken to the Data Viewer page to see a summary of your data.</li>

                    <p>Once your data is loaded, the next step is to clean it. This page provides several tools to fix common data quality issues. Use the tabs to navigate between different cleaning actions.</p>
                    <ul>
                        <li><strong>Handle Missing Values:</strong> Select one or more columns and choose a strategy (e.g., 'drop', 'fill with mean') to handle empty cells.</li>
                        <li><strong>Convert Data Type:</strong> Change the type of a column, for example, from text to a number.</li>
                        <li><strong>Remove Duplicates:</strong> Click the button to remove any identical rows in your dataset.</li>
                        <li><strong>Standardize Text:</strong> Clean up text columns by making them all lowercase, uppercase, etc.</li>
                        <li><strong>Handle Outliers:</strong> Manage extreme numerical values that could skew your results.</li>
                        <li><strong>Correct Inconsistencies:</strong> Fix typos or merge similar categories (e.g., 'USA' and 'United States') by providing a Python dictionary of mappings.</li>
                    </ul>
                    <p>After each action, the data preview at the top of the page will update to reflect your changes.</p>

                    <p>This is where you get to explore your data visually. Creating plots helps you understand distributions, find relationships, and discover patterns.</p>
                    <ol>
                        <li><strong>Select Analysis Type:</strong>

                                <li><strong>Univariate:</strong> To explore a single variable (e.g., the distribution of 'Age').</li>
                                <li><strong>Bivariate:</strong> To compare two variables (e.g., 'Age' vs. 'Income').</li>
                                <li><strong>Multivariate:</strong> To see the correlation between several numerical variables.</li>
                            </ul>
                        </li>
                        <li><strong>Select Columns:</strong> Based on your choice, select the column(s) you want to analyze.</li>
                        <li>Click "Generate Plot". The interactive visualization will appear at the bottom of the page.</li>

                    <h4 class="mt-4">Phase 4: Feature Engineering</h4>
                    <p>This step involves creating new features or modifying existing ones to improve the performance of machine learning models.</p>
                    <ul>
                        <li><strong>Create Feature:</strong> Create a new column from two existing numeric columns using a mathematical operation.</li>
                        <li><strong>Encode Columns:</strong> Convert categorical (text) columns into numbers. Several methods are available depending on the nature of your data.</li>
                        <li><strong>Scale Features:</strong> Standardize the range of your numerical columns so that they are all on a similar scale.</li>
                        <li><strong>Rename/Drop Columns:</strong> Organize your dataset by renaming columns or removing ones you don't need.</li>
